In this folder you will find all the data you need to process and analyze the transcriptomics and proteomics sections of this course.

All the datasets are stored in the `./data/` folder, you will find 5 datasets:


- `raw_counts_transcriptomics`: raw counts from RNAseq
- `transcriptomics_design`: match sequencing samples to biological samples
- `gene_id_matching`: match different IDs for genes in *Synechocystis* genome
- `functional_categories`: functional categories for genes in *Synechocystis*' genome taken from CyanoBase (2019-04-11)
- `proteomics`: log ratios from proteomics

The data analyses are captured in the Rmarkdown file in `./reports/`
